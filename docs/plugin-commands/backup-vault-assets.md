## Backup All Vault Assets to Cloudinary

!!!warning
This is an experimental feature.  Your mileage may vary as to the success of this command because of the issues already outlined in [uploading single note content](upload-single-note-cloudinary.md) and [upload all note contents](upload-all-notes-cloudinary.md).  This command attempts to read all "non-markdown" files in your vault and upload a copy of them to Cloudinary.  The "Backup Folder" option is where these files are stored.  The "Preserve File Paths" option attempts to maintain the same foldering structure you have in your vault, prepended with your specified backup folder as the root.
