This will take all local assets located in the current note and attempt to upload them to Cloudinary.","It is strongly recommended to take a backup of your notes before you perform this action. As part of the action, your local media assets are not deleted when the upload to Cloudinary happens, so you can still reference them if you wanted to. However, because of the nature of the upload, and the variability of syntax in how some users may choose to reference media, this may alter the formatting of your notes. Use with caution.","The success / failure of this plugin largely depends on the following factors:","Your Cloudinary plan -- Certain Cloudinary plans have quotas applied to their accounts. Consult Cloudinary documentation to understand what your limits are","The file types being uploaded -- Cloudinary only accepts certain file types to be uploaded to their servers. If you try to upload an unsupported file type, the upload for that specific file will fail.
